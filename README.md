# **RAG Chat-bot Setup Instructions**

To use the RAG Chat-bot, please follow these steps:

1. **Download the Files**:
   Download the project files from the GitHub repository: [GenAI_Miniproj1](https://github.com/FMS07/GenAI_Miniproj1)

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Navigate to the downloaded project directory using your terminal or command prompt. Then, install the necessary dependencies by running:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Chat-bot**:
   After installing the dependencies, run the RAG Chat-bot using Streamlit with the following command:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

4. **Access the Chat-bot Interface**:
   Once the Chat-bot server starts, open your web browser and go to the provided local URL (usually starts with `http://localhost:8501`). This will open the RAG Chat-bot interface, allowing you to interact with it.

Note: It's recommended to run the RAG Chat-bot on your local system, as there may be issues with running Streamlit apps on Google Colab.
